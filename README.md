Roundabout Tournament Management Software

This program will allow tournament organizers to make a public display of rankings, standings, eliminations, etc. It will also have the functionality of randomizing elements of the tournament, such as making the brackets, and then having it organize the format (single elimination, double elimination, round robin, etc).

The original intention is for it to be used with fighting games like Super Smash Bros and rhythm games like In The Groove or Pump It Up, but it is versitile enough to be used for sports, card games, etc.

Development is ongoing as part of CS467 Capstone Project at Oregon State University.
